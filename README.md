# CS 450 Fall 2023 Algorithms Projects Implementations by Jesse Jones

## Overview
	These are the projects I implemented in Fall of 2023 at university for my algorithms class. All projects are implemented in Rust and demonstrate my knowledge of Rust gained in making these projects.
## Contents

### first_project
This project is a matrix multiplier algorithm done as efficiently
as possible.
### second_project
This project invovled beating Rust's standard sorting function by 
creating a custom sorting function that utilized Counting Sort to
vastly speed up sorting the high scores input data.
