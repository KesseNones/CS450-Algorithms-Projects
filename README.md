# CS 450 Fall 2023 Algorithms Projects Implementations by Jesse Jones

## Overview
	These are the projects I implemented in Fall of 2023 at university for my algorithms class. All projects are implemented in Rust and demonstrate my knowledge of Rust gained in making these projects.
## Contents

### first_project
A matrix multiplier algorithm done as efficiently
as possible.

### second_project
The project involved with beating Rust's standard sorting function by 
creating a custom sorting function that utilized Counting Sort to
vastly speed up sorting the high scores input data.

### third_project
An implementation of a Scapegoat Tree and AVL Tree using an arena as a quasi-heap, in order to speed the program up and get around Rust's ownership and borrowing rules. This was easily the hardest project to implement of the five.

### fourth_project
An example of using dynamic programming to make the classic player knapsack problem get solved in linear time (O(n)).
